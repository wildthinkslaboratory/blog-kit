### About My Site

*Authors who have copied this blog-kit template should replace the text in this About.md*

This is my website and blog where I write about the things that interest me, including (*these are just examples*):

- Pre-punk rock music
- Karaoke
- Recreational Mathematics
- Victorian-era Science Fiction
- Beat Poetry

### About Me

I am a nondescript being of unknown gender and background.

It is probably a good idea to replace this content with something more appropriate for you, the actual author.


#### A picture of me, the Author

Smartdown (and Markdown) make it easy to include images. If you happen to have an image URL, you can use it pretty easily. For example, here's a picture of me if I happened to be a Walrus:
