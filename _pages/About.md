### About the Site

This is a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)-based blog that utilizes the Jekyll services provided by GitHub, and optionally enables some posts and pages to utilize Smartdown, an in-browser renderer of enhanced Markdown and a reactive runtime.

The source for this site is at [smartdown/blog-kit](https://github.com/smartdown/blog-kit/) (v0.0.3).

### About the Author

I am a nondescript being of unknown gender and background.

It is probably a good idea to replace this content with something more appropriate for you, the actual author.


#### A picture of me, the Author

Smartdown (and Markdown) make it easy to include images. If you happen to have an image URL, you can use it pretty easily. For example, here's a picture of me if I happened to be a Walrus:
