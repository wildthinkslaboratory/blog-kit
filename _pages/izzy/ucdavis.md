### When
 - **step 1** Manually register to take the test on September 6 at 11:00
 - **step 2** Take the test on September 6 at a time of your choosing.

 ### Structure of the Test
 - 90 min timed test
 - 60 multiple choice questions
 - No calculus questions all precalc
 - A score above 40 is considered very good as long as you get enough of the trig questions correct

 ### How to prepare
 **day 1**  Review this [list](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/application/files/9716/2060/0419/AlgebraWorkshops.pdf) of algebra topics required.

 **day 2** Review this [list](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/application/files/6616/2060/0418/Trig-Workshops1-4.pdf) of trig concepts you need to know.

**day 3** Take this [online practice](http://diagnostic.math.berkeley.edu/exam.php) test.  I think it will regenerate with new questions to keep on taking it until you can get 100% correct.  Look up the thinks you don't know.  I took a stroll through it and there was a question that used a trig identitiy.  

**day 4** Take these [practice tests]( https://mdtp-wri.ucsd.edu/practice_tests/index.php). You can just enter in uc davis and dummy information for the teacher and class period.  

**day 5** Take another practice test.
