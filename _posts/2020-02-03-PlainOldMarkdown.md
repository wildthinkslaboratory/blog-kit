## GitHub-Flavored Markdown with Kramdown

BlogKit supports the standard [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) provided by GitHub Pages. Specifically, GitHub Pages uses the [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) processor to convert Markdown into HTML within the GitHub Pages server.

### Markdown Examples

Here are some simple examples of Markdown.

#### Styles

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

#### Tables

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
